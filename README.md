## Configuration

There is few configuration in Wetty:
* Startup config (listen port, URL path, SSH host) is contained in the systemd service file
* User interface configuration is done through the web GUI itself.

## Documentation

* Official documentation: https://github.com/butlerx/wetty/tree/master/docs
* YunoHost documentation: If specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## YunoHost specific features

#### Multi-user support

* Is LDAP and HTTP authentication supported ? **No**
  * Nevertheless, being connected on Yunohost prevents using `/wetty/ssh/<user>`

Multi-user doesn't really mean anything. You can log as any *system* user that allows local SSH login.

You can specify at install if users should log into YunoHost first to be able to access Wetty, or if visitors can access it too.

#### Supported architectures

* x86-64 - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/wetty%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/wetty/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/wetty%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/wetty/)

## Limitations

* You can't use ssh key authentication.
