## Overview

Terminal over HTTP and HTTPS. WeTTy is an alternative to ajaxterm and anyterm but much better than them because WeTTy uses xterm.js which is a full fledged implementation of terminal emulation written entirely in JavaScript. WeTTy uses websockets rather then Ajax and hence better response time.


**Shipped version:** 2.7.0~ynh2
